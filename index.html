    Hi, you've reached the personal home page of Berk Özbalcı. I live in Ankara, Turkey. I'm a final year CS student in Middle East Technical University and a part-time software engineer at <a href="https://www.udemy.com">Udemy.</a> At Udemy, I'm part of the Payments Team, helping over 30 million students and over 42,000 instructors have a smooth payments experience on our platform.
</p>

<p>
    I am a singer in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxImhz_vuEdh2NRYk46JmGA">Jazzberry Tunes</a>, an a cappella choir founded in 2014 by METU students. I have participated in countless concerts in the last 4 years.
</p>

<p>
    I am mainly interested in computers, mathematics and music. My favorite computer science subjects are theory of compilers and programming language design. I like to {listen to, compose, analyze} music. One of my childhood dreams was to build a programmable music instrument.
</p>

<p>
    I like reading about architecture, industrial design, data visualization, UI/UX design and typography. The design of this website is not an indicator of my design preferences; it's an expression of false nostalgia (websites looking like this were not popular when I was first introduced to the Internet).

<p>This site is named after the King Crimson song. The site is, and always be, under construkction.</p>
