In this page, I maintain a list of (mostly technology related) terms like “rewind”, which are still used every day, even though they have lost their original meaning.

* _bug_ (computing): An error or flaw in a computer program. The first bug was a moth trapped in an electromechanical computer. The bug was carefully removed and taped to a log book. (See also debugging).
* _burning and dodging_ (in photography): These are tools in Photoshop to manipulate the exposure of selected areas in a photo. The terms originate from actual [dark room processes.][1]
* _car_: Short for carriage.
* _carbon copy_ (e-mail): The common abbreviation is CC. A copy of the e-mail is sent to some other people in th CC list. In the typewriter days, a sheet of carbon stained paper was placed between two pages so that the letters typed on the first page were copied onto the second page.
* _clip art_ (documents): Refers to drawings that came in a book full of stock images. Users would _clip_ out images with scissors and place them onto a page.
* _cut and paste_ (software): The older practice was to physically cut up paper with text on it and glue it back on a new place.
* _dashboard_: A panel under the windscreen of a car or aircraft, containing indicator dials, compartments and sometimes controls. Also, it’s used to refer to data visualiations on user interfaces. The oldschool meaning refers to a barrier of wood to protect the carriage from mud and dirt dashed up by the hooves of the horse.
* _dial_ (a number): Originates from the [_rotary dial._][2] The digits used to be arranged in a circular layout, and you would rotate the wheel.
* _flashing_ (in electronics): As in “flashing the BIOS”. Back in the day, with EPROM chips, you’d peel back a sticker so that the chip would be exposed to UV light, allowing it to be reprogammed.
* _floppy disk icon_: Commonly used as an icon of saving. Floppy disks are not commonly used anymore.
* _footage_: Today it’s used to describe videos. In the good old days, it was a measurement of the length of the film (in feet).
* _hang up the phone:_ Refers to the termination of a phone call. Back in the day, phones were wall mounted and you would hang up the phone on the wall fixture after a call.
* _icon_: The original meaning is a small representation of Jesus or a saint.
* _Italic type_ (in typography): _Italic type was first designed in Italy._
* _patch_ (in computing): Refers to a piece of software that aims to update a program to fix bugs or improve it. The first patches were physical patches on [punched tapes.][3]
* _podcast_: A portmanteau of “iPod” (an Apple media player) and “broadcast”.
* _press_: As in news organizations. Such news organizations are still called “press” even though printing press is no longer being used.
* _rolling up/down a window_: Refers to manual car windows that were rolled using a handle.
* _soap opera_: A serial drama on TV or the radio that focuses on emotional relationships. They were usually sponsored by soap manufacturers. The association is no longer present, but the name has stuck.
* _track_ (music): Used when referring to songs. In the days of the vinyl record, songs were recorded on tracks (i.e. grooves) in the record’s surface.
* _trailer_ (as in movie trailers): Commercial for a movie that will be released in the future. It’s called a “trail”er because originally they were shown at the end of screening. This practice didn’t last long because people left the theater after the movies ended, but the name has stuck.
* _turning lights on and off_: Probably originates from the time where gaslights were controlled by a valve which you would turn.
* _uppercase and lowercase_ (in typography): Uppercase letters are ABC, lowercase letters are abc. In printing press, each glyph was a die that was placed in a frame, then inked and pressed on a paper. Those dies are stored in drawers or cases. The capital letters were in the top drawers (upper case) and lowercase letters were in the bottom drawers.
* _we’re rolling_ (idiom, cinema): Used when recording footage. Refers to the film rolling in the camera.
