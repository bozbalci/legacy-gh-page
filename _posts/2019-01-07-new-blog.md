Hello and welcome to my new blog!

I have always been a fan of how websites looked back in the early 90s. This is my attempt at creating a website that _looks_ like that it was created in the 90s, while employing modern technologies like the static site generator Jekyll. You can view the source code for this website at [its GitHub repository.][gh-repo]

Until next time!
